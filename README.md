KinectChipCounter
=================

A Kinect application designed to look at a poker table and count the chips.

Please note . . . dll references are there, but the dlls are not.  Nothing is included with this project that you can't download yourself.

Make sure to get the following libraries:

Emgu - http://www.emgu.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
Kinect SDK - http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindowsdev/start.aspx
Windows SDK or just .NET SDK - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/hh852363.aspx

All the necessary libraries should be included.  You might have to clean up some references, but it should be pretty close here.

There's lots coming.  Once I can recognize and count chips, I plan on creating a display that will be projectable onto the poker table in real time.

I had initially planned to do this with RFID chips, and might down the road, but the Kinect and OpenCV are proving a pretty badass combination.  Features will keep coming as I dream them up.

Ideally, I'd like to create a fully interactive poker table, with chip counts displayed right on the table, hand evaluation done automatically, and players able to interact with hand gestures, or through virtual interfaces projected on the table.

Big plans, yes.  But we start small.  Counting a recognizing chips . . . that's the first step.

Enjoy!
